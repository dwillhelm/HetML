# HetML  

Framework to develop and deploy machine learning models that predict material properties of van der Waal heterostructures. Acompaning repo for **"Predicting Van der Waals Heterostructures by a Combined Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory Approach"** published in ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.2c04403

## Framework  
Target Properties: 
* Band Gap Energy (eV) 
* Ionization Energy (eV) 
* Electron Affiniity (eV) 
* Interlayer Distance (Angstrom)  
* Interlayer Binding Energy (meV/Angstrom^2)   
* (Coming Soon!) Charge Transfer (via Bader Analysis) 
* (Coming Soon!) Dipole Moment
* (Coming Soon!) In-plance lattice constant  


Some Deep learing models were also tested and can be found at this [repo](https://github.com/dwillhelm/DeepHetML)

## ToDo: 
- [ ] Get dataset 
- [ ] Structure library --> compressed.  
- [ ] src code and setup into local package 
- [ ] figures and interactive figures (in notebook?)

- [x] Setup public repo to accompany publication
